# TFY4235 Computational Physics
Jupyter notebooks and scripts with code examples, as shown in the lectures of
TFY4235 Computational Physics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology,
originally in the spring of 2016, and then updated and significantly expanded for
the spring of 2021.

The examples are shown in class as part of the lectures, and with
supporting material. They are not intended to be completely stand-alone or
self-explanatory.
